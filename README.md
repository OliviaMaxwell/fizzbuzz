# Getting Started with Python using FizzBuzz
using Python 3.8.9

## Objectives
- Set up a new Python project
- Manipulate variables
- Use conditional and looping logic
- Use functions with parameters
- Test-drive using `unittest`

## Task
- Test-drive a program that takes a max number and returns a string.
- The string should list out the numbers counting up to and including the given max number
    1. substituting Fizz where the number is divisible by 3
    2. Buzz where it is divisible by 5
    3. FizzBuzz where it is divisible by both 3 and 5.
